Can you generate terraform code from these docstrings and add them as comment: "Provider Block: aws in us east 1.0" and "Create a AWS VPC resource with private network 10.0.0.0/16" and "Create AWS subnets resource in private network 10.0.1.0/24 and map public ip on launch set true. Use VPC id" and "create a nat gateway, use private connectivity type and subnet id"
