# Description

This Repository is for the paper "Enhancing the Security of Terraform Scripts through Prompt Optimization of Large Language Models" by Valentin Hartig, Elias Berger, Maximilian Frank and Felix Sandmair.
It includes all the data we presented in our study and the scripts that were used to analyse this data.
Additionally, there is our research prototyp for generating secure Terraform scripts by using Auqasecuritys tfsec and OpenAIs ChatGPT.


# Usage of Prototpye

Install the requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

Adjust directory names in the python files to your needs.

Run `python3 Secure_Terraform_Prototype_A.py` to start the prototype.

# Results

Can be found in the `analysis_script` folder. The `analysis_script` folder contains the scripts used to analyze the data collected. It provides an overview of the data analysis process and the scripts used to perform the analysis. Using the notebooks, you can reproduce the analysis and the figures presented in the paper.
