    "prompt": "Can you create a Terraform script to deploy an AWS EC2 instance?",
    "response": "Certainly! Here is an example Terraform script that deploys an AWS EC2 instance:\n\n```\n# Configure the AWS provider\nprovider \"aws\" {\n  access_key = \"<ACCESS_KEY>\"\n  secret_key = \"<SECRET_KEY>\"\n  region     = \"<REGION>\"\n}\n\n# Create the EC2 instance\nresource \"aws_instance\" \"example\" {\n  ami           = \"<AMI_ID>\"\n  instance_type = \"t2.micro\"\n\n  tags = {\n    Name = \"Example EC2 instance\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis script does the following:\n\n1. Configures the AWS provider using the provided access key, secret key, and region.\n2. Creates an EC2 instance using the specified AMI ID and instance type. The instance is also given a Name tag.\n\nTo use this script, you will need to replace the placeholders with your own values. The `<ACCESS_KEY>` and `<SECRET_KEY>` placeholders should be replaced with your AWS access key and secret key, respectively. The `<REGION>` placeholder should be replaced with the desired region code (e.g. \"us-east-1\"). The `<AMI_ID>` placeholder should be replaced with the ID of the AMI that you want to use to launch the instance.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions."

    "prompt": "Can you enable at rest encryption?",
    "response": "Yes, you can enable at-rest encryption for an EC2 instance by using the `ebs_block_device` block in your Terraform script. Here's an example of how you can do this:\n\n```\nresource \"aws_instance\" \"example\" {\n  # Other configuration options...\n\n  ebs_block_device {\n    device_name = \"/dev/sda1\"\n    volume_size = 8\n    encrypted   = true\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis will create an encrypted EBS volume and attach it to the EC2 instance as the root volume (`/dev/sda1`). The volume will have a size of 8 GB.\n\nYou can also enable encryption for additional EBS volumes by adding additional `ebs_block_device` blocks with different `device_name` values.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions."
